Part 3

By the deadline, extend the game from Part 2 with these additional features:

1) The game takes place over many turns. Each turn takes 1.5 seconds.

2) The airplanes can carry cargo.

3) Each turn a vehicle is in its starting location, it gains 10 tons of cargo (never above max capacity).

4) Show the current cargo value somewhere on screen.

5) If the player presses an arrow key while there is an active airplane, the airplane moves in that direction on the next turn. 
	If the player touches many arrow keys between turns, only move one space total, in the most recently touched direction. 
	The airplane is restricted to the grid. 

	a. Each airplane has a cargo capacity of 90 tons.

	b. At the beginning of the game, each airplane has no cargo.

6) There is a delivery depot in the lower right (black cube). If a vehicle reaches that location, it delivers all its cargo.

	a. The player gets 1 point for each ton of cargo delivered.

7) Show the player’s current score somewhere on screen.

If you complete this part before the deadline, go on to the next part.

Final

By the deadline, create a game that functions as follows:

1) The game starts with a 16x9 grid of white cubes, evenly spaced, created by the C# script.

2) There is one airplane that starts in the upper left, with a cargo capacity of 90.

3) There is a delivery depot in the lower right (black cube). If a vehicle reaches that location, it delivers all its cargo.

	a. The player gets 1 point for each ton of cargo delivered.

4) The game takes place over many turns. Each turn takes 1.5 seconds.

5) Each turn a vehicle is in its starting location, it gains 10 tons of cargo (never above max capacity).

6) When the player clicks a vehicle, it should highlight in some way to show that it’s the active vehicle. (Change to a different color, glow, etc.)

	a. If there is an active vehicle and the player clicks a different vehicle, the new vehicle should activate, and the old vehicle should deactivate.

7) If the player clicks the active vehicle, it should deactivate.

8) While there is an active vehicle, if the player clicks any location, the active vehicle should start to move to the clicked location. 
	Movement should happen as follows:

	a. Movement happens one grid space at a time (diagonally is OK), once each turn.

	b. The vehicle remembers where it’s trying to go from turn to turn. Each turn it will move one space in the right direction, 
		until it reaches its destination.

	c. The moving vehicle remains active, so it can be given a new destination partly through the movement.

9) If the player clicks a white cube while there is no active vehicle, nothing happens.

If you complete the final part before the deadline, try some Challenge by Choice items below.

Challenge by Choice: Do any or all of the following additional tasks. I've included categories below, but you can pick and choose however you want.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Game Design Complexity

1) There is one airplane, one train, and one boat, as follows:

Vehicle Cargo Cap. Start Loc. Color Speed 

Airplane 90 Upper Left Red Fast 

Train 200 Lower Left Green Medium 

Boat 550 Upper Right Blue Slow 

2) Movement:

a. Fast vehicles move once each turn.

b. Medium speed vehicles move every other turn.

c. Slow vehicles move every third turn. 

3) Grid locations may have more than 1 vehicle.

d. Movement happens one grid space at a time (diagonally is OK), once 

each turn.

e. The vehicle remembers where it’s trying to go from turn to turn. Each 

turn it will move one space in the right direction, until it reaches its 

destination.

f. The moving vehicle remains active, so it can be given a new 

destination partly through the movement.

a. If the player clicks on a location with multiple vehicles, do something 

reasonable to pick which vehicle becomes active.

b. There should never be more than one active vehicle at a time, though.

Feedback to the Player

 Whenever players mouse-over any location (but before clicking on it), give a 

visual indication that it’s clickable (change the color a bit, enlarge it slightly, 

etc. Your choice of what to do, but do something.)

 Somewhere on the screen, display a count-up timer that shows how long the 

game has been going.

 Somewhere on screen, display the player's current score.

o If showing the game timer, make it fancy: After 59 seconds, show 

1:00 instead of 60. After 60 minutes, show 1:00:00 instead of 60:00.

o Along with the player's current score, show the word "Score."

o At the moment the player earns points, display the points earned 

somewhere (+10!). 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sound Effects

 Whenever the player clicks a vehicle, play a sound effect (SFX).

 Whenever the player clicks a vehicle, play a different SFX depending on which 

type of vehicle it is.

 Play music that loops, so there's constantly music playing during the game.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Visual Polish

 Make the vehicles and sky look prettier, instead of just being simple colored 

cubes. You can change the shape, texture, etc. The goal is making it pretty. 

Feel free to add a background to the game, too.

 Instead of having the vehicle be cubes, have the vehicles move on top of the 

cubes, from cube to cube
